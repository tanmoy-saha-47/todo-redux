📝 Basic React Redux Todo App

A simple and clean Todo List application built with **React** and **Redux**.  
This project helped me understand the **Redux state management** pattern for the first time by applying it in a real-world use case.

---

## 🚀 What I Built

This is a basic Todo app that lets you:

- ✅ Add tasks
- ❌ Delete tasks
- 📦 Store and manage todos using **Redux**

It’s a minimal app with just enough features to practice and learn how **React Redux works**.

---

## 🧠 What I Learned

This was my **first project using Redux**, and through this app I learned:

- How to create and configure a Redux slice using `createSlice`
- How to use `useDispatch` and `useSelector` to interact with the Redux store
- How to connect Redux state to React components
- How to update and delete items from global state

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- ⚛️ React
- 🗃️ Redux Toolkit
- 🎨 Tailwind CSS (for styling)
- 🔧 Vite / Create React App (depending on your setup)

---

## 🧩 Features

- Add a todo using the input field and button
- See the list of all added todos
- Delete a todo using the ❌ delete button
- The UI is centered and styled using Tailwind CSS

## 🙌 Acknowledgement

- This is my first hands-on project with Redux. I'm still learning and plan to build more features like:

- Edit todo

- Mark complete

- Save todos in localStorage
