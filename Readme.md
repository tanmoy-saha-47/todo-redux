 Basic React Redux Todo App

A simple and clean Todo List application built with **React** and **Redux**.  
This project helped me understand the **Redux state management** pattern for the first time by applying it in a real-world use case.

---

##  What I Built

This is a basic Todo app that lets you:

- Add tasks
- Delete tasks
- Store and manage todos using **Redux**

It’s a minimal app with just enough features to practice and learn how **React Redux works**.

## Features

- Add a todo using the input field and button
- See the list of all added todos
- Delete a todo using the ❌ delete button

---

## Learnings


- How to create and configure a Redux slice ("createSlice")
- How to interact with the Redux store (`useDispatch` and `useSelector`)
- How to connect Redux state to React components
- How to update and delete items from global state

---

## Tech Stack

-  React
-  Redux Toolkit
-  Tailwind CSS
-  Vite 

---

- This is my first hands-on project with Redux. I'm still learning and plan to build more features like:

- Edit todo

- Mark complete

- Save todos in localStorage
